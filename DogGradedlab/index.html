                <li>Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for
                    applying
                    to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have
                    advanced
                    memory skills. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200
                    different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly
                    retrieved
                    those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of another Border
                    Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and
                    could
                    associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately to human
                    body
                    language such as gesturing, pointing, and human voice commands.</li>
                <li>One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional
                    than
                    those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. One limited study of 18 household
                    dogs
                    found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focused on the "what" of a task rather than
                    the
                    "where".</li>
                <li>Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed
                    compelling
                    evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving,
                    indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities
                    once
                    they joined humans. Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple
                    manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human,
                    while socialized wolves do not. </li>
